# Testing

The specs repository starts with baseline structural verification and will grow
into the conformance suite for all NostrSeal implementations.

## Current Baseline

```sh
make ci
```

The baseline check verifies required files, directory layout, README license
section, CI workflow, license marker, schemas, examples, and cryptographic
fixtures.

## Required M1 Tests

- JSON schemas validate all valid examples.
- Invalid examples fail for the expected reason.
- NIP-01 event id fixtures match canonical serialization.
- BIP-340 signatures verify against deterministic test keys.
- QR envelope roundtrips preserve the request payload exactly.

## Fixture Verification

`scripts/verify_specs.py` computes NIP-01 event ids from canonical serialized
events and verifies committed BIP-340 signatures using libsecp256k1 bindings.
It also checks that invalid request examples remain rejected.

## Completion Standard

Spec changes are not complete until examples, schemas, fixtures, and docs are
updated together.
